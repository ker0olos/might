End-to-end testing can get very complicated and overwhelming; especially if you need to start testing huge apps, that would take a lot of time and afford, and will be boring and repetitive.

### The Solution

A no-code method to perform and manage end-to-end tests, handling all of the mess in the background.

[Might UI](https://github.com/ker0olos/Might) is an easy way to create, manage and edit tests,
and [Might CLI](https://github.com/ker0olos/might-cli) runs those tests.

### Installation

> For a better experience, use Might with a browser that supports the [File System Access API](https://web.dev/file-system-access/); Chrome/Chromium 86+

</br>

`npm install --save-dev might-cli might-ui`

### Usage
`npx might -m` or `npx might-ui`.

After that it opens automatically in your browser, **(to actually run the tests you need to use [might-cli](https://github.com/ker0olos/might-cli)).**
